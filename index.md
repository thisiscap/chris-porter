My work continues to involve an ever expanding range of physical<sup>1</sup> and digital<sup>2</sup> outcomes but at the core of each project is an original creative direction, unique to the challenges facing each client. Working with a designer is a collaborative process and I believe that great work stems from working closely with people who love what they do.

[](Some recent projects I have worked on include:)

[](- The design for No Royal Road, a report on the embracing of uncertainty and unpredictability of advocacy in the evaluation of social change.)
[](- Another example jansldalkmclamskmdas.)

[](I have been fortune to have worked with some great people including _Universal Music_, the _Heritage Lottery Fund_ and _TEDx Brighton_.)
