Working across the physical and digital with a keen interest in all things tactile. I see design as a collaborative process and that great work comes from working with people who love what they do.

[](Some recent projects I have worked on include:)

[](- The design for No Royal Road, a report on the embracing of uncertainty and unpredictability of advocacy in the evaluation of social change.)
[](- Another example jansldalkmclamskmdas.)

[](I have been fortune to have worked with some great people including _Universal Music_, the _Heritage Lottery Fund_ and _TEDx Brighton_.)
