# Brighton based graphic designer, currently working at 05creative*

Interested in helping people find meaningful, creative solutions to their unique challenges. I enjoy working with people who love what they do. Most recently I helped launch a new brand and website for Just Economics, a research organisation for social change.

Branding is at the core of my practise, if you would like to see my work, I am happy to send out my portfolio of my work if you get in touch.

During my career I have bern lucky to have worked with some great people including:

- [Universal Music](#)
- [Deaf Children’s Society](#)
- [Heritage Lottery Fund](#)
- [Create Bespoke](#)
- [TEDx Brighton](#)
- [The Women’s Budget Group](#)
- [#ge2017forwomen](#)
- [Just Economics](#)
- [John Graham](#)
- [East Studio](#)

Interested in working together? All great projects start with a conversation.
