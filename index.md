# Brighton based graphic designer, currently working at [05creative](https://05creative.com/)*

I help people find meaningful, creative solutions to their unique challenges. I enjoy working with people who love what they do. Most recently I helped launch a new brand and website for Just Economics, a research organisation for social change.

Branding is at the core of my practise, if you would like to see examples of my work, I am happy to send out my portfolio of my work if you [get in touch](mailto:email@domain.com).

During my career I have been lucky to have worked with some great people including:

- [BHWS Deaf Children’s Society](http://www.bhwsdcs.org.uk/)
- [Heritage Lottery Fund](https://www.hlf.org.uk/)
